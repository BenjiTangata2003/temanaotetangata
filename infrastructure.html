    <h1>Infrastructure & Technology Policy</h1>

    <h2>Background</h2>
    <p>In Aotearoa, essential infrastructure — from internet to transport systems — is increasingly privatised, expensive, and unequal in its reach. Rural communities, low-income whānau, and Māori are often digitally excluded. Technological infrastructure is dominated by profit-driven corporations, and public services are undermined by fragmented, market-based models.</p>

    <p>The digital divide deepens existing inequities and limits access to education, employment, civic participation, and healthcare. Infrastructure should be public, accessible, and future-focused — not sold to the highest bidder.</p>

    <h2>Vision</h2>
    <p>We envision a sovereign, people-powered Aotearoa where essential infrastructure — digital, transport, energy, and communications — is publicly owned and community-controlled. Everyone deserves affordable access to the tools, services, and systems that enable full participation in society.</p>

    <h2>Objectives</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Guarantee universal access to internet and digital tools as a basic human right.</li>
      <li>Reclaim essential infrastructure from corporate ownership.</li>
      <li>Close the digital divide by investing in underserved communities.</li>
      <li>Use technology to serve social equity, decolonisation, and democratic participation.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Policy Commitments</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Provide free or subsidised high-speed internet access to all households, particularly rural, remote, and low-income communities.</li>
      <li>Nationalise key infrastructure sectors, including telecommunications, digital platforms, and strategic transport systems.</li>
      <li>Guarantee digital education, devices, and training to all students and adults who need it — from tamariki to kaumātua.</li>
      <li>Ban the privatisation of essential services and repeal any laws that enable outsourcing or asset sales of critical infrastructure.</li>
      <li>Establish a Te Tiriti-based national data and digital governance framework, ensuring Indigenous data sovereignty and community control over digital systems.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Implementation Plan</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Create a Public Digital Service Authority to oversee national internet access, digital infrastructure investment, and public technology rollouts.</li>
      <li>Expand the Rural Broadband Initiative and equip all public spaces (e.g. marae, libraries, community centres) with free Wi-Fi and learning hubs.</li>
      <li>Introduce the Universal Device Access Programme to provide free laptops, tablets, and basic digital skills training to all who need them.</li>
      <li>Audit all existing infrastructure contracts to identify and reverse unnecessary privatisation.</li>
      <li>Partner with iwi, hapū, and Māori tech experts to build Indigenous-led digital platforms, databases, and cybersecurity systems.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Timeframe</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Year 1–2:</strong> Begin free internet rollout; launch public device access programme; pass anti-privatisation legislation.</li>
      <li><strong>Year 3–5:</strong> Complete full rural broadband coverage; transition telecommunications to public ownership; build 100+ free digital hubs.</li>
      <li><strong>Year 6–10:</strong> Achieve digital equity across all communities; embed Māori data governance as a national standard.</li>
    </ul>
