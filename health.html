    <h1>Health Policy</h1>

    <h2>Background</h2>
    <p>Aotearoa’s healthcare system remains underfunded and unequal. Māori, Pasifika, disabled, LGBTQIA+ communities, and low-income whānau continue to face systemic barriers to accessing timely, culturally safe, and comprehensive care. Dental care is unaffordable, mental health services are stretched thin, and critical areas like reproductive and gender-affirming healthcare are inaccessible for many. The removal of the Māori Health Authority has weakened Māori-led health governance at a time when structural equity is urgently needed.</p>

    <h2>Vision</h2>
    <p>Health is a collective and cultural right — not a privilege. We envision a universal, holistic health system that restores tino rangatiratanga, embraces Indigenous healing, and delivers mana-enhancing, identity-affirming care for all. Everyone should be able to access the care they need, when they need it — free from stigma, cost, or delay.</p>

    <h2>Objectives</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Provide universal, free access to essential healthcare including dental, mental, reproductive, and gender-affirming services.</li>
      <li>Restore Māori control over hauora (health) systems and embed rongoā Māori as a recognised and resourced healing practice.</li>
      <li>Deliver preventative, community-led care that supports wellbeing across the life course.</li>
      <li>Protect and support gender-diverse youth through informed, affirming, and whānau-inclusive health pathways.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Policy Commitments</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Guarantee universal public healthcare, including free dental and mental health services for all.</li>
      <li>Restore full funding and independence to the Māori Health Authority, ensuring decision-making sits with Māori at all levels.</li>
      <li>Provide free access to period products, contraception, abortion services, and gender-affirming healthcare across the country.</li>
      <li>Support access to gender-affirming care for children and youth through age-appropriate, consent-based pathways — including social transition, puberty blockers, and mental health care — with involvement from whānau and trained medical professionals.</li>
      <li>Establish holistic wellbeing centres led by communities, providing integrated health, rongoā, mental health, and social services.</li>
      <li>Honour and fund rongoā Māori and intergenerational healing practices as central to Aotearoa’s public health system.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Implementation Plan</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Legislate free dental and mental healthcare under the public system via amendments to the NZ Public Health and Disability Act.</li>
      <li>Reinstate and expand the Māori Health Authority, co-governed with iwi and hapū.</li>
      <li>Launch a Gender-Affirming Youth Health Pathways Programme, co-designed with trans advocates, whānau, clinicians, and youth.</li>
      <li>Fund Community Wellbeing Hubs offering wraparound care including GP services, counselling, rongoā, and peer support.</li>
      <li>Expand access to culturally safe gender and sexual diversity training for all healthcare professionals.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Timeframe</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Year 1–2:</strong> Remove public dental costs; re-establish Māori Health Authority; roll out free contraception and period products; launch gender-affirming youth programme.</li>
      <li><strong>Year 3–5:</strong> Open 100+ wellbeing hubs; fund puberty blockers and mental health care for trans youth; embed rongoā in all primary care networks.</li>
      <li><strong>Year 6–10:</strong> Achieve full access to debt-free, culturally safe, community-led healthcare across Aotearoa.</li>
    </ul>
