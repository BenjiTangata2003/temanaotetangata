  <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold mt-4 mb-2">Background</h3>
  <p class="mb-4">
    Aotearoa’s current justice system is rooted in colonial control and systemic inequality.
    Māori make up over 50% of the prison population despite being just 17% of the general population.
    Prisons perpetuate cycles of trauma, violence, and intergenerational harm without addressing root causes like poverty,
    colonisation, mental illness, and addiction. Billions are spent maintaining a punitive system that fails to deliver
    safety, rehabilitation, or justice.
  </p>

  <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold mt-4 mb-2">Vision</h3>
  <p class="mb-4">
    We believe in a justice system that heals rather than harms — one that restores balance, upholds mana,
    and addresses the social roots of harm. Our vision is a future without prisons, where justice is relational,
    transformative, and led by the communities most affected by harm.
