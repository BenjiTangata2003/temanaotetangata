  <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold mt-4 mb-2">Background</h3>
  <p class="mb-4">
    Aotearoa’s ecosystems are in crisis. Centuries of colonisation, extractive industries, and intensive agriculture have degraded waterways, deforested land, and pushed species to extinction.
    Climate change threatens our homes, food systems, and future generations — but government responses remain slow, market-driven, and disconnected from Indigenous wisdom.
    Environmental governance has too often excluded iwi and hapū, despite Te Tiriti obligations and kaitiakitanga (guardianship) responsibilities.
  </p>

  <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold mt-4 mb-2">Vision</h3>
  <p class="mb-4">
    We envision an Aotearoa where the environment is healed and protected through Indigenous leadership, collective stewardship, and intergenerational care.
    Climate justice means centring Māori sovereignty, restoring whenua, and ensuring that people and nature thrive together.
    Our economy must work in harmony with the living systems we depend on.

  <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold mt-4 mb-2">Objectives</h3>
  <ul class="list-disc list-inside mb-4">
    <li>Transition to a regenerative, post-carbon economy.</li>
    <li>Return environmental governance to iwi and hapū.</li>
    <li>Recognise the rights of nature through legal personhood.</li>
    <li>Invest in food, transport, and housing systems that restore ecosystems — not deplete them.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold mt-4 mb-2">Policy Commitments</h3>
  <ul class="list-disc list-inside mb-4">
    <li>Ban all oil and gas exploration, including offshore drilling and fracking, to stop new fossil fuel extraction.</li>
    <li>Invest in regenerative agriculture, reforestation, and ecological restoration projects led by iwi, hapū, and local communities.</li>
    <li>Grant legal personhood to rivers, forests, mountains, and ecosystems, recognising their intrinsic rights and whakapapa.</li>
    <li>Return governance of lands, waters, and taonga species to iwi and hapū, as rightful kaitiaki under Te Tiriti o Waitangi.</li>
    <li>Support community-based climate adaptation and resilience strategies, especially in coastal, rural, and low-income areas.</li>
    <li>Invest in solar power, electric rail, active transport, and local food systems that reduce emissions and build collective resilience.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold mt-4 mb-2">Implementation Plan</h3>
  <ul class="list-disc list-inside mb-4">
    <li>Enact the Aotearoa Climate Justice Act, embedding binding emissions targets and Indigenous governance structures into law.</li>
    <li>Phase out all fossil fuel subsidies and redirect funding into clean energy infrastructure and Māori-led environmental restoration.</li>
    <li>Establish a National Ecosystem Recovery Fund to support wetland regeneration, native tree planting, and biodiversity protection.</li>
    <li>Legislate legal personhood frameworks for key ecosystems (e.g. Taranaki Maunga, Waitākere Ranges) in collaboration with mana whenua.</li>
    <li>Create community climate hubs offering resources, training, and support for whānau to transition to sustainable living.</li>
