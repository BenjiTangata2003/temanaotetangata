  <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold mt-4 mb-2">Background</h3>
  <p class="mb-4">
    Aotearoa’s healthcare system remains underfunded and unequal. Māori, Pasifika, disabled, LGBTQIA+ communities, and low-income whānau continue to face systemic barriers to accessing timely, culturally safe, and comprehensive care.
    Dental care is unaffordable, mental health services are stretched thin, and critical areas like reproductive and gender-affirming healthcare are inaccessible for many.
    The removal of the Māori Health Authority has weakened Māori-led health governance at a time when structural equity is urgently needed.
  </p>

  <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold mt-4 mb-2">Vision</h3>
  <p class="mb-4">
    Health is a collective and cultural right — not a privilege.
    We envision a universal, holistic health system that restores tino rangatiratanga, embraces Indigenous healing,
    and delivers mana-enhancing, identity-affirming care for all. Everyone should be able to access the care they need, when they need it — free from stigma, cost, or delay.
  </p>

    <li>Restore Māori control over hauora (health) systems and embed rongoā Māori as a recognised and resourced healing practice.</li>
    <li>Deliver preventative, community-led care that supports wellbeing across the life course.</li>
