  <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold mt-4 mb-2">Background</h3>
  <p class="mb-4">
    Education in Aotearoa has long been shaped by colonial narratives, inequitable access, and underinvestment in Māori and community-led knowledge systems.
    While student debt continues to rise, many schools remain under-resourced. Te reo Māori and true Aotearoa history are still absent from many classrooms,
    and tertiary education is financially out of reach for thousands.
  </p>

  <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold mt-4 mb-2">Vision</h3>
  <p class="mb-4">
    We believe education should be free, empowering, and grounded in the diverse cultures, histories, and knowledges of Aotearoa.
    A truly liberatory education system must honour Te Tiriti o Waitangi, restore mana motuhake (self-determination),
    and equip future generations to thrive, not just survive.
