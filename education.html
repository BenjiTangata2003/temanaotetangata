    <h1>Education Policy</h1>

    <h2>Background</h2>
    <p>Education in Aotearoa has long been shaped by colonial narratives, inequitable access, and underinvestment in Māori and community-led knowledge systems. While student debt continues to rise, many schools remain under-resourced. Te reo Māori and true Aotearoa history are still absent from many classrooms, and tertiary education is financially out of reach for thousands.</p>

    <h2>Vision</h2>
    <p>We believe education should be free, empowering, and grounded in the diverse cultures, histories, and knowledges of Aotearoa. A truly liberatory education system must honour Te Tiriti o Waitangi, restore mana motuhake (self-determination), and equip future generations to thrive, not just survive.</p>

    <h2>Objectives</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Make high-quality education free and accessible at all levels.</li>
      <li>Restore Māori and Pacific knowledge systems as core foundations of learning.</li>
      <li>Decolonise curricula and classrooms across the country.</li>
      <li>End the student debt trap and ensure all learners are supported to succeed.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Policy Commitments</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Make tertiary education free for all, including vocational training and postgraduate study.</li>
      <li>Teach Aotearoa’s true history and Te Tiriti o Waitangi across all schools from Years 1 to 13.</li>
      <li>Make te reo Māori compulsory in all primary and secondary schools.</li>
      <li>Cancel existing student debt over time through a phased national forgiveness programme.</li>
      <li>Fund hapū and iwi-led education pathways that centre tikanga, whakapapa, and mātauranga Māori.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Implementation Plan</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Pass legislation to abolish all fees for public universities, polytechnics, and wānanga.</li>
      <li>Integrate a mandatory Aotearoa Histories and Te Tiriti curriculum in collaboration with iwi, historians, and educators.</li>
      <li>Provide full funding and workforce support to train and retain teachers of te reo Māori and kaupapa Māori education.</li>
      <li>Develop a National Student Debt Forgiveness Fund, starting with those in social work, education, and healthcare.</li>
      <li>Invest in hapū and iwi education authorities to develop, accredit, and deliver culturally grounded learning experiences and qualifications.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Timeframe</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Year 1–2:</strong> Legislate free tertiary education; begin Te Tiriti and Aotearoa Histories integration; expand teacher training for te reo Māori.</li>
      <li><strong>Year 3–5:</strong> Make te reo Māori compulsory in all schools; launch student debt forgiveness fund; establish hapū education authorities.</li>
      <li><strong>Year 6–10:</strong> Cancel all student debt; expand Māori- and Pasifika-led institutions; complete decolonised curriculum rollout.</li>
    </ul>
