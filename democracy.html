    <h1>Democracy & Governance Policy</h1>

    <h2>Background</h2>
    <p>Aotearoa’s political system is shaped by colonial institutions that continue to exclude Indigenous governance, prioritise corporate influence, and limit meaningful participation by everyday people. Te Tiriti o Waitangi remains unhonoured in constitutional law, while voter turnout is declining, particularly among young, Māori, and working-class communities. Decisions are too often made behind closed doors — influenced by wealth, not public will.</p>

    <h2>Vision</h2>
    <p>We envision a truly democratic Aotearoa grounded in Te Tiriti o Waitangi, where governance is co-created by tangata whenua and tangata Tiriti, and all people can participate meaningfully in shaping their futures. Democracy must be local, inclusive, participatory, and free from corporate control.</p>

    <h2>Objectives</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Establish a written, Te Tiriti-based constitution that enshrines Indigenous sovereignty and participatory democracy.</li>
      <li>End corporate influence over politics and restore public trust in democratic institutions.</li>
      <li>Empower rangatahi, whānau, hapū, and communities to shape policy and decisions that affect them.</li>
      <li>Create democratic infrastructure for the 21st century that enables transparency, inclusivity, and shared power.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Policy Commitments</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Draft and ratify a Te Tiriti-based Constitution for Aotearoa, recognising Māori sovereignty, collective rights, and ecological governance.</li>
      <li>Implement co-governance across all public institutions, including health, education, justice, and environmental management.</li>
      <li>Ban corporate political donations and impose strict limits on lobbying, to end undue influence over public policy.</li>
      <li>Fund citizens’ assemblies, participatory budgeting initiatives, and local decision-making platforms to bring democracy closer to communities.</li>
      <li>Lower the voting age to 16, ensuring rangatahi are heard and empowered in the democratic process.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Implementation Plan</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Establish a Constitutional Transformation Commission co-led by tangata whenua and tangata Tiriti to design a new democratic framework through public deliberation and consensus.</li>
      <li>Enact legislation to ban corporate donations, cap campaign spending, and require real-time transparency of political funding.</li>
      <li>Launch local democracy hubs across the motu where citizens can engage in planning, policy discussions, and collaborative problem-solving.</li>
      <li>Develop digital and in-person platforms for citizen participation, accessible in multiple languages and formats.</li>
      <li>Partner with kura, schools, and youth organisations to embed civic education and political literacy from early adolescence.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Timeframe</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Year 1–2:</strong> Ban corporate donations; launch Constitutional Transformation Commission; initiate citizens' assemblies in pilot regions.</li>
      <li><strong>Year 3–5:</strong> Pass legislation lowering the voting age to 16; roll out participatory budgeting nationally; implement co-governance in public services.</li>
      <li><strong>Year 6–10:</strong> Complete constitutional transformation and national ratification; embed participatory democracy and rangatahi representation into law.</li>
    </ul>
