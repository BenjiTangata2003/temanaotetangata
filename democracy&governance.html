  <h2 class="text-3xl font-bold mb-4 text-red-700">Democracy & Governance Policy</h2>

  <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold mt-4 mb-2">Background</h3>
  <p class="mb-4">
    Aotearoa’s political system is shaped by colonial institutions that continue to exclude Indigenous governance, prioritise corporate influence,
    and limit meaningful participation by everyday people. Te Tiriti o Waitangi remains unhonoured in constitutional law,
    while voter turnout is declining, particularly among young, Māori, and working-class communities.
    Decisions are too often made behind closed doors — influenced by wealth, not public will.
  </p>
  <p class="mb-4">
    For democracy to thrive, it must be transformed — from top-down representation to genuine power-sharing, participation, and decolonisation.
  </p>

  <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold mt-4 mb-2">Vision</h3>
  <p class="mb-4">
    We envision a truly democratic Aotearoa grounded in Te Tiriti o Waitangi, where governance is co-created by tangata whenua and tangata Tiriti,
    and all people can participate meaningfully in shaping their futures. Democracy must be local, inclusive, participatory, and free from corporate control.
  </p>
