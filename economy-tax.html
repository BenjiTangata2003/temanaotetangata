    <h1>Economy & Tax Policy</h1>

    <h2>Background</h2>
    <p>Aotearoa’s economy has been shaped by decades of neoliberal policies that prioritise corporate profits over community wellbeing. Wealth inequality has reached record highs. While the wealthiest accumulate unproductive capital, many New Zealanders struggle with low wages, rising living costs, and insecure work. The current tax system heavily burdens income earners while largely exempting wealth, capital gains, and financial speculation — creating an unjust and unsustainable economic model.</p>

    <h2>Vision</h2>
    <p>We envision an equitable, post-capitalist economy rooted in collective wellbeing, ecological balance, and tino rangatiratanga. Our economy must serve people, not markets — and shift from growth for growth’s sake to one that measures success by how well we care for each other and the whenua.</p>

    <h2>Objectives</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Redistribute wealth fairly to reduce inequality and poverty.</li>
      <li>Ensure that essential needs — housing, food, transport — are guaranteed to all.</li>
      <li>Shift economic policy from GDP-based metrics to holistic wellbeing indicators.</li>
      <li>End tax privileges for the ultra-wealthy and speculative finance.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Policy Commitments</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Introduce a wealth tax on net assets over $2 million.</li>
      <li>Implement a capital gains tax and a financial transactions tax.</li>
      <li>Remove GST from food, medicine, and other essential goods and services.</li>
      <li>Guarantee universal basic services — such as housing, energy, and transport — to reduce reliance on cash income.</li>
      <li>Close tax loopholes and enforce corporate tax compliance.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Implementation Plan</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Pass the Economic Justice Act introducing wealth, capital gains, and financial transaction taxes.</li>
      <li>Amend the GST Act to eliminate tax on essential goods and services.</li>
      <li>Establish a Universal Basic Services Fund to deliver essential public goods without charge.</li>
      <li>Create a Wellbeing Economics Advisory Council to replace GDP with holistic wellbeing indicators in budgeting and policy.</li>
      <li>Hire and train new Inland Revenue enforcement teams to audit high-net-worth individuals and corporations.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Timeframe</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Year 1–2:</strong> Introduce and pass tax reform legislation; remove GST on food and essentials; create UBS Fund.</li>
      <li><strong>Year 3–5:</strong> Begin implementation of wealth and financial taxes; expand access to basic services.</li>
      <li><strong>Year 6–10:</strong> Achieve full transition to a wellbeing-based economy; reduce income inequality and poverty by 50%.</li>
    </ul>
