  <h1>Economy & Tax Policy</h1>

  <h2>Background</h2>
  <p>
    Aotearoa’s economy has been shaped by decades of neoliberal policies that prioritise corporate profits over community wellbeing. Wealth inequality has reached record highs. While the wealthiest accumulate unproductive capital, many New Zealanders struggle with low wages, rising living costs, and insecure work. The current tax system heavily burdens income earners while largely exempting wealth, capital gains, and financial speculation — creating an unjust and unsustainable economic model.
  </p>

  <h2>Vision</h2>
  <p>
    We envision an equitable, post-capitalist economy rooted in collective wellbeing, ecological balance, and tino rangatiratanga. Our economy must serve people, not markets — and shift from growth for growth’s sake to one that measures success by how well we care for each other and the whenua.
  </p>

  <h2>Objectives</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Redistribute wealth fairly to reduce inequality and poverty.</li>
    <li>Ensure that essential needs — housing, food, transport — are guaranteed to all.</li>
    <li>Shift economic policy from GDP-based metrics to holistic wellbeing indicators.</li>
    <li>End tax privileges for the ultra-wealthy and speculative finance.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Policy Commitments</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Introduce a Wealth Tax on net assets over $2 million to ensure the ultra-rich contribute their fair share to public wellbeing.</li>
    <li>Implement a Capital Gains Tax on property, shares, and investment profits to close loopholes and reduce housing speculation.</li>
    <li>Apply a Financial Transaction Tax (FTT) to discourage short-term speculation and generate revenue from large-scale financial trades.</li>
    <li>Remove GST on food and essential goods to immediately ease pressure on low-income households.</li>
    <li>Guarantee universal access to housing, food, and public transport as baseline economic rights, not privileges.</li>
    <li>Replace GDP as the primary economic measure with Wellbeing Indicators aligned with health, housing, education, equity, and environmental restoration.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Implementation Plan</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Establish an Independent Economic Justice Commission to design and administer the Wealth Tax and Capital Gains Tax, ensuring transparency and accountability.</li>
    <li>Amend the Income Tax Act and Goods and Services Tax Act to remove GST from essential goods (e.g. fruit, vegetables, bread, milk, period products, hygiene supplies).</li>
    <li>Develop a Wellbeing Economic Framework in partnership with Māori, Pasifika, unions, and social sector organisations to replace GDP metrics across government departments.</li>
    <li>Create a Public Guarantee Fund to provide access to basic services (housing, kai, and transport) for all citizens and residents.</li>
    <li>Introduce legislation to regulate financial trading and implement the FTT on high-volume transactions, particularly those by hedge funds and institutional investors.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Timeframe</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Year 1:</strong> Remove GST from essential goods; introduce draft legislation for Wealth and Capital Gains Taxes; begin development of wellbeing indicators.</li>
    <li><strong>Year 2–3:</strong> Implement new tax systems; launch public guarantee for housing, food, and transport; operationalise Financial Transaction Tax.</li>
    <li><strong>Year 4–5:</strong> Fully transition national economic reporting to the Wellbeing Framework; expand public ownership and democratic participation in the economy.</li>
  </ul>
