  <h1>Housing Policy</h1>

  <h2>Background</h2>
  <p>
    Aotearoa faces a deepening housing crisis. Decades of privatisation, market speculation, and underinvestment in public housing have left thousands of whānau without safe, secure, or affordable homes. Home ownership has plummeted, while rent prices continue to rise disproportionately to income. Māori, Pasifika, and low-income communities are disproportionately affected, with many experiencing intergenerational housing exclusion.
  </p>

  <h2>Vision</h2>
  <p>
    We believe that housing is a human right — not a privilege or commodity. Everyone in Aotearoa deserves a warm, dry, affordable home within thriving, connected communities grounded in whenua and care.
  </p>

  <h2>Objectives</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Eliminate housing insecurity and homelessness.</li>
    <li>Restore housing sovereignty to iwi and hapū.</li>
    <li>Create a sustainable, non-speculative housing system focused on collective wellbeing.</li>
    <li>Empower community-led and regenerative housing developments.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Policy Commitments</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Build 200,000 state-owned papakāinga homes over 10 years, prioritising whānau in need and enabling culturally grounded living.</li>
    <li>Cap rents at 25% of household income across both public and private rental sectors to ensure affordability.</li>
    <li>Ban land banking and speculative investment in housing, introducing penalties for vacant or unused residential land.</li>
    <li>Return confiscated and Crown-held whenua to iwi and hapū, enabling self-determined housing and land use.</li>
    <li>Fund regenerative, community-led housing models including co-housing, urban marae, eco-villages, and papakāinga rooted in tikanga Māori and sustainable design.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Implementation Plan</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Establish a Ministry for Housing Justice to oversee public housing construction, regulate private rentals, and coordinate community housing initiatives.</li>
    <li>Amend the Residential Tenancies Act to introduce a rent cap framework and stronger tenant protections.</li>
    <li>Enact a Vacant Property Levy to discourage speculation and make land available for social use.</li>
    <li>Partner with iwi, hapū, and Māori housing providers to co-design papakāinga developments using tikanga-based planning principles.</li>
    <li>Provide grants and low-interest loans for community housing cooperatives and not-for-profit developers.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Timeframe</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Year 1–2:</strong> Legislate rent caps; launch public housing construction programme; return initial blocks of Crown land to iwi and hapū.</li>
    <li><strong>Year 3–5:</strong> Construct 60,000 homes; roll out vacant land levy; fund 500+ community-led housing projects.</li>
    <li><strong>Year 6–10:</strong> Complete all 200,000 homes; ensure full national implementation of rent caps; expand papakāinga and cooperative housing networks nationwide.</li>
  </ul>
