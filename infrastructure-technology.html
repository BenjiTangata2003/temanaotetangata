  <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold mt-4 mb-2">Background</h3>
  <p class="mb-4">
    In Aotearoa, essential infrastructure — from internet to transport systems — is increasingly privatised, expensive, and unequal in its reach.
    Rural communities, low-income whānau, and Māori are often digitally excluded.
    Technological infrastructure is dominated by profit-driven corporations, and public services are undermined by fragmented, market-based models.
  </p>
  <p class="mb-4">
    The digital divide deepens existing inequities and limits access to education, employment, civic participation, and healthcare.
    Infrastructure should be public, accessible, and future-focused — not sold to the highest bidder.
  </p>

  <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold mt-4 mb-2">Vision</h3>
  <p class="mb-4">
    We envision a sovereign, people-powered Aotearoa where essential infrastructure — digital, transport, energy, and communications —
    is publicly owned and community-controlled. Everyone deserves affordable access to the tools, services, and systems that enable full participation in society.
  </p>

  <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold mt-4 mb-2">Objectives</h3>
  <ul class="list-disc list-inside mb-4">
    <li>Guarantee universal access to internet and digital tools as a basic human right.</li>
    <li>Reclaim essential infrastructure from corporate ownership.</li>
    <li>Close the digital divide by investing in underserved communities.</li>
    <li>Use technology to serve social equity, decolonisation, and democratic participation.</li>
  </ul>

    <li>Guarantee digital education, devices, and training to all students and adults who need it — from tamariki to kaumātua.</li>
    <li>Ban the privatisation of essential services and repeal any laws that enable outsourcing or asset sales of critical infrastructure.</li>
    <li>Establish a Te Tiriti-based national data and digital governance framework, ensuring Indigenous data sovereignty and community control over digital systems.</li>
