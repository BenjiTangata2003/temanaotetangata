  <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold mt-4 mb-2">Background</h3>
  <p class="mb-4">
    Aotearoa’s transport system is heavily car-dependent, expensive, and polluting. Rural communities are isolated, public transport options are limited,
    and fossil fuel use contributes significantly to greenhouse gas emissions. Decades of underinvestment in public and active transport have left many people —
    especially those without cars — disconnected from work, health services, education, and whānau.
  </p>
  <p class="mb-4">
    Transport should connect, not exclude. But the current system prioritises profit-driven infrastructure over people, whenua, and the planet.
  </p>

  <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold mt-4 mb-2">Vision</h3>
  <p class="mb-4">
    We envision a just, accessible, and climate-safe transport system that serves all communities — not just the wealthy or urban elite.
    Transport should be free, low-emission, and designed around hauora, whanaungatanga, and collective wellbeing.
  </p>
