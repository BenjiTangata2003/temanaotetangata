    <h1>Transport Policy</h1>

    <h2>Background</h2>
    <p>Aotearoa’s transport system is heavily car-dependent, expensive, and polluting. Rural communities are isolated, public transport options are limited, and fossil fuel use contributes significantly to greenhouse gas emissions. Decades of underinvestment in public and active transport have left many people — especially those without cars — disconnected from work, health services, education, and whānau.</p>

    <h2>Vision</h2>
    <p>We envision a just, accessible, and climate-safe transport system that serves all communities — not just the wealthy or urban elite. Transport should be free, low-emission, and designed around hauora, whanaungatanga, and collective wellbeing.</p>

    <h2>Objectives</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Provide free and accessible public transport across the country.</li>
      <li>Reduce transport emissions through electrification and active transport infrastructure.</li>
      <li>Reconnect rural and remote communities.</li>
      <li>Reclaim public space from cars for community, nature, and wellbeing.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Policy Commitments</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Make all public transport free — including buses, trains, and ferries — for all residents and visitors to Aotearoa.</li>
      <li>Expand public rail services and intercity connections, including electric and regional rail networks.</li>
      <li>Build safe, connected bike lanes and walkable streets in all towns and cities.</li>
      <li>Reclaim urban space by repurposing roads for people-focused uses like parks, markets, gardens, and play areas.</li>
      <li>Support the development of community-owned transport cooperatives and provide grants for low-emission vehicles, including e-bikes and electric vans.</li>
      <li>Improve rural and marae-based transport access, including on-demand services, car-share systems, and solar-powered transport hubs.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Implementation Plan</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Establish a National Public Transport Agency responsible for service expansion, fare removal, and nationwide coordination.</li>
      <li>Pass legislation to abolish public transport fares and require local councils to integrate services across regions.</li>
      <li>Launch a Green Transport Infrastructure Fund to build bike lanes, EV infrastructure, and solar-powered transit stations.</li>
      <li>Invest in rural and remote transport pilots, co-designed with mana whenua and local whānau.</li>
      <li>Redirect highway expansion funds into rail, community transit, and mobility equity programmes.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Timeframe</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Year 1–2:</strong> Eliminate all public transport fares; launch rail expansion plan; fund rural and marae transport pilots.</li>
      <li><strong>Year 3–5:</strong> Double national rail coverage; complete protected bike networks in all major cities; open 50+ community transport hubs.</li>
      <li><strong>Year 6–10:</strong> Achieve universal access to free, clean, and integrated transport; reduce national transport emissions by at least 60%.</li>
    </ul>
